# Logitivity Repository Conventions

## Naming

The naming of repositories is simple and falls under two categories.

1. If the repository is a Top Level Application, the naming is CamelCase.
2. If the repository is anything but a Top Level Application (library, information, etc) - The naming 
is all lowercase with a hyphen.
